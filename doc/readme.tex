\section{Introduction}
This readme will explain what Breakaway does and how to configure it to meet your needs. Breakaway is a relatively straightforward program, but it has an advanced plugin framework which allows additional functionality to be added. 

\section{What Breakaway Does}
Breakaway allows you to control iTunes by monitoring your interaction with the headphone jack and system volume controls.  For example, say you are listening to a song in iTunes when your phone rings. Press mute on your keyboard and Breakaway pauses iTunes. Unmute your computer, and Breakaway will resume iTunes. Listening with headphones and need to leave your seat for a minute? Breakaway has your back. When you remove the cord from the jack, Breakaway pauses iTunes for you. When your replug back in, iTunes resumes for you.

This only scratches the surface of what Breakaway can do though. What about locking down the computer when you hit mute? Or how about muting {\em everything} when you unplug your headphones? Breakaway can be configured to do these things and much more, and will be explained later in this document.
